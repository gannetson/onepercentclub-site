# The monthly donor email will be sent under these conditions:
#
# 1) A user has manually selected a project for a monthly donation.
# 2) The monthly donation is active.
#
# The email is sent regardless of how the project became full. For instance, the email will be sent if the project
# becomes full during the month by a single donation and if it becomes full during the monthly donation batch job.
#
# The email will only be sent the first time that the project becomes full. If a donation fails and the project moves
# back to the campaign phase and then subsequently becomes full again, the email will not be sent a second time.
